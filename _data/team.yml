      <p>I am an Oaxaca native and in 2013 founded Conversa Creativa with the idea of adding my grain of sand to improving sustainable public and private investment in Mexico. Since then I have worked to generate tools, apply knowledge and promote interaction between the public, private and social sectors. I like work with solid technical foundations and in diverse groups, with fluid communication and constant innovation.</p>
      <p>I studied Political Science at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) and hold a Master’s in Development Economics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. I would like to continue studying and when I have the opportunity I plan to specialize in climate funding and mobilizing private capital. Since 2005 I have worked in Alternativas y Capacidades A.C., the Secretary of Social Development, the Secretary of the Interior and in the Secretary of Finance of the Government of the State of Oaxaca.</p>
